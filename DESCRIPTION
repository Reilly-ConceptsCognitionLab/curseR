Description: In American English, many new curse words (e.g., asshat) emerge from combinations of      
    existing curse words with common nouns (e.g., ass+hat).  This combinatorial process is not   
    random. In 2020, our lab reported some of the semantic and phonological properties that govern 
    such combinations (see https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-019-01685-8). These 
    processes constitute an algorithm implemented in the curseR Rpackage. The curse() function 
    produces a series of new polysyllabic curse words on demand. The default is 3 words, but users 
    are invited to produce any number of curse words they desire by specifying that number in the 
    function call. For example, typing 'curse(15)' will generate 15 curse words nobody has ever seen 
    before.
