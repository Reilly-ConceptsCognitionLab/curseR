# curseR: algorithmic generation of compound curse words

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Overview
curseR generates novel combinations of curse words by combining existing English curse words with common nouns from several categories (e.g., professions, dwellings, receptacles, body parts). These combinations follow an algorithm for 'building the perfect curse word' outlined in: <br/>

Reilly J, Kelly A, Zuckerman B, Twigg P, Wells M, Jobson K, & Flurie M (2020) Building the perfect curse word:  A psycholinguistic investigation of the form and meaning of taboo words. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review. 27(1), 139-148. doi:10.3758/s13423-019-01685-8. <br/>

Our study was even featured in Discover Magazine!  <br/>

I curated these curse words from several sources, including:
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/bad-words.txt  <br />
https://github.com/coffee-and-fun/google-profanity-words <br />

I omitted hate speech, racial, and ethnic slurs from the lookup databases.  Users should be warned though that the list is still composed of some very strong profanity, including body part slang. 

## Installation
Install the development version of curseR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) by typing the following in your console or script (make sure you have devtools installed):

``` {r, eval=F}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Reilly-ConceptsCognitionLab/curseR")
```

## Run it!
There is only one function, and that function only takes one argument.
The function is curse(), and the argument is just an integer specifying how many curse words you would like the function to return
```{r, eval=F}
curse()  #by default returns a character vector of three curse words
curse(10) #returns a character vector of 10 curse words
curse(50) #returns a character vector of 50 curse words
```
